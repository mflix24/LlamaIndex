# LlamaIndex
This is a repository for understanding the basic concept of llamaindex.


# Llama-Index :
LlamaIndex is a data framework for LLM-based applications which benefit from context augmentation. Such LLM systems have been termed as RAG systems, standing for "Retrieval-Augemented Generation". LlamaIndex provides the essential abstractions to more easily ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data in order to inject these safely and reliably into LLMs for more accurate text generation.

Llama-Index follows 5 rules
01. Data Ingestion
02. Search
03. Retrieval
04. Indexing
05. Ranking and Structuring
